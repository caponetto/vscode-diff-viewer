A simple wrapper for [diff2html](https://github.com/rtfpessoa/diff2html) library to easily visualize git diff files in the VS Code.

**Note**: The file extension must be `.diff` or `.patch` to be properly loaded by VS Code.

The extension saves the state of viewed/not viewed files in the diff file itself.
